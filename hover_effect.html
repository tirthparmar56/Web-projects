            Single Mode Fiber
        </h1>
        <p>
            Single mode fiber, short as SMF, is the fiber cable that only allows one mode of light to transmit.
            Typically, this fiber includes a small light-carrying core of about 9µm diameter. These feature a small
            modal dispersion for vast-distance signal transmission. <br>

            In contrast with multimode fiber, single mode enables the concentration of light to go quicker and farther.
            That is crucial for high-speed networks over a long distance.

        <h1>
            Multimode Mode Fiber
        </h1>

        <p>
            Unlike single mode, multimode fiber (MMF) allows multiple light modes to transmit and pass through.
            Typically, this fiber includes a large light-carrying core of about 50µm or 62.5µm diameter. That makes
            manufacturing easier and offers a lower cost ratio on the same length.

            However, due to modal dispersion, this limits the most significant length of transmission connections. So,
            these fibers are mainly for the short-distance transmission of signals.

            Step Index Fiber
        </h1>
        <p>
            Step index fiber is a type of optical fibers that holds its classification on the basis of refractive index. Step index fiber is that optical waveguide, that has a constant refractive index within the core and another constant refractive index within the cladding.
            The refractive index of the core is somewhat more as compared to that of the cladding. However, it is to be noted here that at the core-cladding interface the refractive index shows sudden variation.

        <h1>
            Graded Index Fiber
        </h1>
        <p>
            Graded Index fiber is another type of optical fiber in which the refractive index of the core is non-uniform. This non-uniformity is present because the refractive index is higher at the axis of the core and continuously reduces with the radial movement away from the axis.
            However, the refractive index of the cladding is constant in the case of graded index fiber. Hence the nature of the refractive index of the core is somewhat parabolic.
